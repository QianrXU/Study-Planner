The cardiovascular system is able to do this because mechanical forces are sensed by tissues, and deviations from 'normal' results in biological changes which affect structure.

Teams are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers.

More than 80% of electronic data in modern societies are generated and stored in textual format. How to process unstructured text to extract useful insights and support actionable decision making and discover the hidden treasure of collective intelligence is of enormous value. In this unit, we start with traditional text processing techniques using Regular Expressions and discuss the needs of text processing and normalisation. We then introduce fundamental pipelines of natural language processing (NLP), including part-of-speech tagging and various ways of sentence parsing, with the aim of introducing traditional text feature collection techniques for higher-level tasks such as sentiment or document classification. Building on the understanding of the pros and cons of feature-based NLP pipeline approaches, the unit moves onto the modern approach of deep learning for NLP, focusing on word vector representation, neural language models, and recurrent neural networks for NLP.  The unit situates the techniques around major NLP tasks, including information extraction, sentiment detection, dialogue systems and machine translation.",Nil,"No course data stored for this unit.

Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP. It discusses logical and physical design of data warehouses including star schema, snowflake schema, data marts, partitioning and materialised views.

Examples of potential problems include development of environmental management plans for local lakes or cumulative impact assessments associated with urban development.  Students individually produce a “Call for Tender”, as might be issued by a client seeking consulting services.  They then work in teams to write a suitable tender in response.  These tenders form the basis for the second phase of the design project (implementation) undertaken in ENVE5552.  
Lecturers and guest speakers from industry, and technical experts from e.g. UWA, other universities, Government Departments or CSIRO, support the class in consolidating their knowledge, technical skills and familiarity with legal, policy, ethical and social considerations relevant to the project.

Location is an important part of understanding the nature of a phenomenon and its relationships with other aspects of a system.

This unit introduces postgraduate students to GIS, providing training in both the use of the software and the analysis of spatial data. The unit covers the application of GIS in a number of fields/disciplines. Students are introduced to core concepts in GIS and analytical techniques, including spatial sampling, interaction models, and spatial statistics. Students are also provided instruction in the presentation of spatial data and the development of a spatial analytic project from start to finish.

The goal of this unit is to develop an understanding of spatial data and spatial analysis; develop spatial problem-solving abilities; acquire knowledge and skills in GIS across a broad set of applications. Lectures cover fundamentals in the spatial representation of real-world objects, map projections, cartography, data development, and spatial analytic techniques.

Students have the opportunity early in the semester to receive feedback on their draft research proposal from their peers in a supportive environment. Later in the semester they workshop their draft literature review. Students who undertook this unit during the previous semester and are completing their dissertations this semester join the group from time to time and both give feedback to current students on their research proposal and literature review drafts and have the opportunity to have a chapter draft workshopped by the group.

The unit focuses on real world engineering projects and benefits the students significantly by enhancing their capabilities and employability skills. In the unit, students learn to (1) research and analyse a real world engineering project to which key concepts and theories of sustainable and ethical project management are applied—implement a rigorous approach to analysing the project by applying a globally recognised project life cycle framework; (2) identify and analyse the problems encountered in each stage of the project and establish relevant inferences; (3) provide prioritised recommendations based on the benefits and consequences deriving from them; and (4) analyse project stakeholders' input and influence and manage them accordingly. Students enhance their interpersonal skills as they are required to take an active part in group meetings, share group coordination and leadership and learn how to negotiate and solve conflict.

Measurements from a range of sensors (mechanical, optical, electrical) are introduced and subsequent signal conditioning (operational amplifiers, instrumentation amplifiers) are addressed with the aim of maximising signal quality. Statistical methods are discussed to better understand noise processes and how noise can be minimised. Methods to improve signal quality (signal to noise ratio) are discussed. Measurement signal and noise are analysed in both the time and frequency domain to better understand the connection between two domains and the importance of measurement bandwidth. Sampling is reviewed to understand the impact of moving from continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT), including discussion of the Nyquist rate and aliasing.

To achieve this, a systems-approach is implemented to the principles, design and application of the major underground mining methods, such as sublevel stoping, cut-and-fill mining, narrow vein mining, and caving methods.

During the semester, there may be a field trip to some underground mines if the conditions allow it. This trip is likely to last a few days, during the semester study break. Accommodation and food costs are borne by the students, and students must sign a student code of conduct before attending and observe health and safety instructions.",Nil.,,No course data stored for this unit.,"61550 Master of Professional Engineering as core in Mining Engineering [Active];
