This unit focuses on three main areas of data reporting: data visualisation, data storytelling/narrative and data presentation/communication. Data visualisation involves converting raw data to an easily understood visual format that is efficient with ink and effective in portraying the messages in the data. Data storytelling or narrative is the ability to provide informative, engaging and impactful explanations of the data analysis that are relevant to the audience. Effective presentation/communication skills are fundamental for combining data visuals and data storytelling. Collectively they offer analytical output in a simple, clear and meaningful way which aids the translation of data to action. 

This foundation unit provides key competences to effectively present data and findings to a business audience. Students are able to identify appropriate data visualisations for different types of data, gain practical experience in the use of different sophisticated analytical tools and techniques to visualise and analyse data, and communicate analytical findings efficiently, effectively and in a non-technical way.",Nil.,"42630 Master of Business Analytics (coursework) as core [Active] [unique];

In particular, the process of developing appropriate classes, objects and methods to solve simple computational problems underlies the entire unit. Core computer programming topics such as the use of variables, primitive and reference data types, expressions, control structures involving selection and repetition, method decomposition and parameter passing are all covered in this context. Algorithmic techniques such as iteration, sorting, searching along with programming practices such as error handling, testing, debugging and documentation are introduced. The unit also covers advanced topics such as association, inheritance and interface.

We then introduce fundamental pipelines of natural language processing (NLP), including part-of-speech tagging and various ways of sentence parsing, with the aim of introducing traditional text feature collection techniques for higher-level tasks such as sentiment or document classification. Building on the understanding of the pros and cons of feature-based NLP pipeline approaches, the unit moves onto the modern approach of deep learning for NLP, focusing on word vector representation, neural language models, and recurrent neural networks for NLP.

It combines concepts from 'image processing' (in the spatial and frequency domains) and 'pattern recognition'. Computer vision has a wide number of potential applications, including satellite imaging, control and measurement, industrial inspection, surveillance (e.g. face recognition) and medical applications. This unit covers topics such as binary image analysis, greyscale image manipulation, linear and nonlinear filtering, feature extraction, image enhancement, image segmentation and recognition. It also covers camera calibration and projective geometry and how three-dimensional information can be reconstructed from single images, stereo pairs of images and motion sequences. In the future, it is anticipated that computer vision systems will become prevailing, and that vision technology will be more applied across a broad range of business and consumer products. This will result in a strong industry demand for computer vision engineers—for people who understand vision technology and know how to apply it in real-world problems.",Nil,,No course data stored for this unit.,"MJD-ARIDM Artificial Intelligence (BACS|*|) as core [Active];

Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP. It discusses logical and physical design of data warehouses including star schema, snowflake schema, data marts, partitioning and materialised views.

The students learn to program multi core processors using OpenMP, and clusters of personal computers using MPI. Students examine high performance computing case studies from different scientific disciplines and also work on individual or group projects to consolidate their learning.
MapReduce is a programming paradigm for processing large data sets on clusters of computers. The implementation of MapReduce through Spark and the distributed file system HDFS has become a widely used programming model for high performance computing in the last decade. This unit will also introduce students to this programming model through lectures and laboratory exercises.",Nil,"No course data stored for this unit.

Globally, the challenges of paid content online, the decline of print media and the relative quality of broadcast media in the commercial space compared to government-owned media is addressed. The threats to the business model which has underpinned journalism for decades and the challenges financially imposed on the media from online and not-for-profit and citizen journalism are analysed.

Energy use and water availability are closely connected to climate change. How can we make effective decisions as a community about these three interconnected issues? This unit tackles this problem in three modules. Module 1 (energy and climate change) seeks to understand what drives society's demand for energy, how it is affected by energy markets and how energy policies affect greenhouse gas emissions. Module 2 (the economics of climate change) investigates the difficulties of evaluating the economic, environmental and social impacts of climate change and how this affects the effectiveness of climate change policies. Module 3 (water management and policy) seeks to understand what drives water demand and supply, how climate change affects this delicate balance and what policies can help societies adapt to the new climatic conditions. The unit focuses on the economic concepts and tools needed to explain and solve these problems, including supply issues and cost structures, pricing policies, property rights, externalities, cost-benefit analysis and risk management.

Newspaper articles, political programmes and speeches, business reports, tweets, and traditional letters are just some examples of text that hold important information. However, such information isn't always easily accessible, and this unit lays out several paths for doing so. Our focus lies on hands-on experience, and students will themselves conduct several applications in transforming text to data, quantitatively studying their content.

In the context of text-to-data, the researcher's arsenal to explore society-relevant questions expands to novel data sources that were previously inaccessible to quantitative research. Informed by theoretical and qualitative research, we aim to expand that horizon. Relevant data do not need to exclusively come from traditional data sources, such as government and business statistics, surveys, or experimental studies now. One goal of this unit is to broaden our horizon to take advantage of the vast amounts of useful information hidden in unconventional locations.",,"No course data stored for this unit.

Economists view the world through several different lenses. This, in turn, is often a source of disagreement amongst economists and economic policy advisers. Disagreement within the profession often allows non-economists to dismiss or criticise economics and disregard contributions made by economists to economic debates.  Fundamentally, economics is a way of thinking. It offers a powerful framework to help identify trade-offs and policy interventions. To engage in economic debate and influence policy makers, it is critical that economists know how to talk about models, present facts and figures, and distinguish facts from opinion. In this unit you will learn how to communicate economics to a wide range of audiences, including policy makers, politicians and other with no training in economics. Students will learn how to write policy briefs, to use visual tools, and to deal with the media. They will gain insight into how effective communication can be used to influence stakeholders and create change. The instruction will be via a series of guest lectures followed by reflection workshops and through several group and individual assignments.",Nil,"42670 Master of Economics (coursework or coursework and dissertation) as core [Active] [unique];

There is a strong emphasis on applications, illustrating the use of relevant computer software applied to large scale data sets. 

The purpose of the unit is to provide a practical guide to the analysis of health data that is built around a series of case studies based on recent health economics research. The unit is divided into 5 key parts. The first part focuses on health measures and describing and summarising health data. The second part introduces the multivariate analysis of health survey data and issues of how to identify causal effects from empirical data. The third part introduces health equity and the estimation of heterogeneous effects across different subpopulations. The fourth part moves from cross-sectional to longitudinal data, introducing applications with linear and non-linear panel data regression models. Part five turns to methods that are suitable for modelling individual data on health care utilisation when that is measured by the number of visits or by levels of expenditure.",,"No course data stored for this unit.

The unit is designed so that students have a strong grasp of key issues in designing and using assessments and interpreting student results. It focuses on assessment strategies through which assessments are deliberately constructed to measure particular skills and abilities, data are generated, and inferences drawn. The unit is also designed to provide experience in designing and conducting assessments by using core principles that can be generalised to a wide range of learning areas and contexts including primary and secondary school, vocational educational training and tertiary.

A range of assessment types are covered, including multiple choice, short responses, rubrics, and others. Key concepts such as validity and reliability, formative and summative, and criterion and norm-referenced assessment are covered. The unit is based on a conceptual framework within which to understand core principles of educational assessment and measurement. As principles are explained, actual examples are referred to in order to make the principles and their importance tangible.

It considers how cognitive development can be measured through teacher devised assessments and how information about student performance can be used in combination with information from standardised testing programs to provide pictures of individual and group performance. A key principle is that the quality of assessments of individuals is fundamental to the quality of assessment of groups. State standardised testing programs, such as the National Assessment Program Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) and the Monitoring Standards in Education (MSE) program, are discussed in tandem with other measures of cognitive development. Focusing on the principles of quantitative educational research and evaluation, the unit examines the evaluation of both individual and group performance. The unit covers key descriptive methods for interrogating and presenting student results. It introduces simple statistical principles relevant to the interpretation of results including the relevance of student numbers and the implications of changes in cohorts over time; the concept of value adding and strengths and limitations of approaches to evaluating value adding, and key features of data analyses such as those used in Data Club. The unit also identifies appropriate and inappropriate methods of aggregating the results of individuals to evaluate the performance of groups and explains the underlying principles in terms of maximising appropriate use of information.",Nil.,No course data stored for this unit.,No course data stored for this unit.,,"31310 Graduate Diploma in Professional Education as option [Active];

In addition, Positive Mental Health will be discussed. The educational needs associated with children with learning difficulties, communication disorders, physical, intellectual, hearing and visual impairments, disruptive behaviour disorders (ADHD, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder), psychopathy, developmental dyspraxia, intellectual impairment, pervasive developmental disorders and tic disorders provide the focus of the unit. Aspects of developmental psychopathology and family and social systems are also presented. Leading child and adolescent psychiatrists and persons with a developmental psychopathology may be involved to provide an understanding of their role and the role of medication (in the case of the former) and their coping strategies (in the case of the latter) in the management of their neuro-disability. The techniques and strategies used in behavioural, cognitive behavioural and cognitive bias modification approaches in a variety of contexts are discussed. The use of clinical interview and developmental history assessment techniques are examined and substantiated with practical assignments. The contribution of critical antecedents in early childhood and adolescence in the development of psychopathologies and adverse mental health is examined in detail.

The unit introduces students to defining environmental engineering design problems.  Individually, students interpret a client brief to specify tasks, project outcomes and outputs addressing a real-world environmental engineering problem.  Examples of potential problems include development of environmental management plans for local lakes or cumulative impact assessments associated with urban development.  Students individually produce a “Call for Tender”, as might be issued by a client seeking consulting services.  They then work in teams to write a suitable tender in response.  These tenders form the basis for the second phase of the design project (implementation) undertaken in ENVE5552.  
Lecturers and guest speakers from industry, and technical experts from e.g. UWA, other universities, Government Departments or CSIRO, support the class in consolidating their knowledge, technical skills and familiarity with legal, policy, ethical and social considerations relevant to the project.

This unit introduces postgraduate students to GIS, providing training in both the use of the software and the analysis of spatial data. The unit covers the application of GIS in a number of fields/disciplines. Students are introduced to core concepts in GIS and analytical techniques, including spatial sampling, interaction models, and spatial statistics. Students are also provided instruction in the presentation of spatial data and the development of a spatial analytic project from start to finish.

The goal of this unit is to develop an understanding of spatial data and spatial analysis; develop spatial problem-solving abilities; acquire knowledge and skills in GIS across a broad set of applications. Lectures cover fundamentals in the spatial representation of real-world objects, map projections, cartography, data development, and spatial analytic techniques.

Some of the seminar sessions examine major aspects of developing a research project (in this case, the honours or masters dissertation): formulating a research question in relation to existing knowledge; developing a formal research proposal; writing a literature review; structuring the dissertation; and advanced academic style. 

Students have the opportunity early in the semester to receive feedback on their draft research proposal from their peers in a supportive environment. Later in the semester they workshop their draft literature review. Students who undertook this unit during the previous semester and are completing their dissertations this semester join the group from time to time and both give feedback to current students on their research proposal and literature review drafts and have the opportunity to have a chapter draft workshopped by the group.

The unit focuses on real world engineering projects and benefits the students significantly by enhancing their capabilities and employability skills. In the unit, students learn to (1) research and analyse a real world engineering project to which key concepts and theories of sustainable and ethical project management are applied—implement a rigorous approach to analysing the project by applying a globally recognised project life cycle framework; (2) identify and analyse the problems encountered in each stage of the project and establish relevant inferences; (3) provide prioritised recommendations based on the benefits and consequences deriving from them; and (4) analyse project stakeholders' input and influence and manage them accordingly. Students enhance their interpersonal skills as they are required to take an active part in group meetings, share group coordination and leadership and learn how to negotiate and solve conflict. Students also liaise with key industry representatives, giving them the opportunity to establish professional relationships.",Nil.,No course data stored for this unit.,No course data stored for this unit.,"MJD-EAUTO Automation and Robotics Engineering (BE (Hons)|*|BE (Hons) - BSc|*|BE (Hons) - BCom|*|BE (Hons) - BPhil(Hons)|*|) as core [Active];

Students understand issues such as accuracy, precision, repeatability, calibration, uncertainty and noise. Measurements from a range of sensors (mechanical, optical, electrical) are introduced and subsequent signal conditioning (operational amplifiers, instrumentation amplifiers) are addressed with the aim of maximising signal quality. Statistical methods are discussed to better understand noise processes and how noise can be minimised. Methods to improve signal quality (signal to noise ratio) are discussed. Measurement signal and noise are analysed in both the time and frequency domain to better understand the connection between two domains and the importance of measurement bandwidth. Sampling is reviewed to understand the impact of moving from continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT), including discussion of the Nyquist rate and aliasing. The conversion between the analogy to digital domains including CT-DT, system transfer functions, spectral analysis (discrete Fourier transform, discrete-time Fourier transform) and the construction of finite and infinite impulse response filters to reduce noise is discussed.",Nil.,No course data stored for this unit.,No course data stored for this unit.,"MJD-ATRDM Automation and Robotics (BAR|*|) as core [Active];

To achieve this, a systems-approach is implemented to the principles, design and application of the major underground mining methods, such as sublevel stoping, cut-and-fill mining, narrow vein mining, and caving methods.

During the semester, there may be a field trip to some underground mines if the conditions allow it. This trip is likely to last a few days, during the semester study break. Accommodation and food costs are borne by the students, and students must sign a student code of conduct before attending and observe health and safety instructions.",Nil.,,No course data stored for this unit.,"61550 Master of Professional Engineering as core in Mining Engineering [Active];

It provides a multidisciplinary grounding in public health theory and practice that draws on subject matter including biomedical, behavioural and social sciences, and the principles and methods of epidemiology and other research disciplines, thereby providing an integrated view of the discipline. In addition to exploring the origins and development of public health, the unit examines the measurement of population health, major public health challenges in developed and developing countries, and the diverse agents, host factors, social, economic, political and environmental conditions that influence the public's health. The unit also explores social justice and equity issues in public health. Examples of public health research and translation are presented, and learning approaches are tailored, to facilitate an integrated view of public health structure and function, health planning and program evaluation.

Students will achieve transdisciplinary grounding in public health theory and practice, and gain substantial breadth and depth of understanding to appreciate the links between public health history, structure and function; and develop the skills for critical analysis and scientific writing in public health.",Nil,"92550 Master of Public Health (coursework or coursework and dissertation) as core [Active] [unique];

Once upon a time, intuitively attractive statistical procedures had to be consigned to the waste bin if they led to unfathomable mathematical complications, or required masses of intricate calculations for their practical implementation. Now such difficulties can often be circumvented by using computer simulation and number crunching. This has led to the development and widespread use of many new statistical tools including the bootstrap, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and non-parametric kernel smoothing methods. Computer intensive statistical methods are not only in general use by statisticians, but are also applied by quantitative researchers in the life sciences, medicine and biological science, social sciences and business.

This unit gives a broad coverage of computer intensive methods with numerous applied examples, together with the underlying general concepts and basic theory. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of these methods in real statistical applications. Data sets are analysed using the statistical package R.
