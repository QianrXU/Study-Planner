Students have the opportunity early in the semester to receive feedback on their draft research proposal from their peers in a supportive environment. Later in the semester they workshop their draft literature review. Students who undertook this unit during the previous semester and are completing their dissertations this semester join the group from time to time and both give feedback to current students on their research proposal and literature review drafts and have the opportunity to have a chapter draft workshopped by the group. Current students benefit from the experience and insights of students one semester further along in the dissertation writing process.",Nil.,"No course data stored for this unit.

Most organisations usually deploy several relational databases for operational convenience. It is quite often necessary to integrate the information existing in different relational databases for planning and decision making. Data warehouses are built to facilitate planning and decision making in businesses integrating data from different relational databases. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a technology that uses a data warehouse for answering aggregation queries often used in planning. While relational databases hold important transactional information of a business, the success of a business quite often depends on advanced planning and development of strategies based on customer behaviour. Data mining technologies are used for discovering such patterns and trends in data stored in relational databases. This unit introduces the key mechanisms in data warehousing and OLAP. It discusses logical and physical design of data warehouses including star schema, snowflake schema, data marts, partitioning and materialised views.

More than 80% of electronic data in modern societies are generated and stored in textual format. How to process unstructured text to extract useful insights and support actionable decision making and discover the hidden treasure of collective intelligence is of enormous value. In this unit, we start with traditional text processing techniques using Regular Expressions and discuss the needs of text processing and normalisation. We then introduce fundamental pipelines of natural language processing (NLP), including part-of-speech tagging and various ways of sentence parsing, with the aim of introducing traditional text feature collection techniques for higher-level tasks such as sentiment or document classification. Building on the understanding of the pros and cons of feature-based NLP pipeline approaches, the unit moves onto the modern approach of deep learning for NLP, focusing on word vector representation, neural language models, and recurrent neural networks for NLP.  The unit situates the techniques around major NLP tasks, including information extraction, sentiment detection, dialogue systems and machine translation.",Nil,"No course data stored for this unit.

This lies at the heart of all major cardiovascular diseases, which are responsible for about one-third of the world's deaths. The underpinning principle which is referred to several times in this unit is that the cardiovascular system adapts in order to normalise its mechanical environment. The cardiovascular system is able to do this because mechanical forces are sensed by tissues, and deviations from 'normal' results in biological changes which affect structure. 

This unit introduces students to the far-reaching field of cardiovascular biomechanics in health and disease, and provides students with new skills obtained through coursework, laboratories and assignments.",Nil,"No course data stored for this unit.

Examples of potential problems include development of environmental management plans for local lakes or cumulative impact assessments associated with urban development.  Students individually produce a “Call for Tender”, as might be issued by a client seeking consulting services.  They then work in teams to write a suitable tender in response.  These tenders form the basis for the second phase of the design project (implementation) undertaken in ENVE5552.  
Lecturers and guest speakers from industry, and technical experts from e.g. UWA, other universities, Government Departments or CSIRO, support the class in consolidating their knowledge, technical skills and familiarity with legal, policy, ethical and social considerations relevant to the project.

Students are self-guided with the support of the instructor.  They are given the freedom to determine how to organise their workforce, how to implement their tasks, and how to time and stage their project.  Throughout the semester the instructor critically reviews progress, suggests issues for the class to consider addressing, related to technical and project management issues, and assists the class in accessing resources, resolving problems, and decision-making.  At the end of the semester, the students present their solutions to their client and a public audience consisting of relevant stakeholders and participants from UWA.

This unit covers topics such as 3D terrain development, hydrologic and land use modelling, habitat analysis, land suitability/capability analysis, and the spatial examination of landscape values. To conduct this work, students use program coding and/or 'off the shelf' modelling packages. Laboratory assignments expose students to a range of environmental data as well as requiring them to source their own GIS information and apply analytic techniques demonstrated in lectures.

More than 80% of electronic data in modern societies are generated and stored in textual format. How to process unstructured text to extract useful insights and support actionable decision making and discover the hidden treasure of collective intelligence is of enormous value. In this unit, we start with traditional text processing techniques using Regular Expressions and discuss the needs of text processing and normalisation. We then introduce fundamental pipelines of natural language processing (NLP), including part-of-speech tagging and various ways of sentence parsing, with the aim of introducing traditional text feature collection techniques for higher-level tasks such as sentiment or document classification. Building on the understanding of the pros and cons of feature-based NLP pipeline approaches, the unit moves onto the modern approach of deep learning for NLP, focusing on word vector representation, neural language models, and recurrent neural networks for NLP.  The unit situates the techniques around major NLP tasks, including information extraction, sentiment detection, dialogue systems and machine translation.",Nil,"No course data stored for this unit.
