      <button class="accordion-faq"><p>How do I use the Study Planner tool?</p></button>
      <div class="panel-faq">
        <p>The Study Planner tool is a two or three step process depending on whether the course you are interested in planning has majors or specialisations.</p>
        <p>On the first page, you will be asked to select a course. The course you select may have different availability, this will be reflected in the dropdown for selecting your beginning year and semester.</p>
        <p>If the course you have selected has the option of selecting a major or specialisation, you will be asked to select one once you click continue.</p>
        <p>When you have arrived to the Study Planner page, units will appear on the left and a grid will appear on the right (if you are on a desktop - the layout may look different if you are using your mobile).</p>
        <p>Drag units from the left and pull them out to the grid on the right. Watch out for potential conflicts on the grid. If there are any constraints related to the units you select, a text explaining what has gone wrong will appear in the alert bar at the bottom of the page.</p>
        <p>Click <a class="regularlink" href="{{ url_for('createstudyplanSelectCourse') }}">here</a> to create a study plan.</p>
