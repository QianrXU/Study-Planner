# Remaining Issues/Opportunities

## Data

### Data Inconsistencies
- Extra unit data can be added to support more courses and availabilities.
- Edge cases point trackers (point requirements not contained in unit group *typeInto* or course *introduction*)
- Lacking unit groups data for multiple specialisations/majors.


## User Interface

### Multiple Specialisations
- Not available as it requires more unit groups data.
- Some limitations needs to be manually interpreted, *e.g.*, whether students can take a minor only or an extended major with a minor.

### Drag and Drop API
- Not compatible with Safari.
- Does not recognise touch (no support for mobile or tablets).

### Year/Semester Grid
- The grid only provides support for 4 semesters (2 years of full time study). 
- Bachelorâ€™s degrees, doctorates and Business School degrees have been filtered out of course selection dropdown at the moment.
- More grids can be inserted to fulfill the needs for Bachelor courses, Doctorates and Business School degrees or the needs for part-time study plans. 

### Prerequisites to Develop
1. Credit points required.
  - Level based prerequisites.
    - *e.g.*, Completion of 24 points of Level 4/Level 5 units (CITS5206).
  - Field based prerequisites.
    - *e.g.*, Completion of 12 points of programming-based units (CITS5503).
    - *e.g.*, Completion of 24 points postgraduate units (WILG5001).
2. Either or situations.
  - *e.g.*, FINA1221 Introduction to Finance; or FINA2221 Introduction to Finance (FINA2207).
3. Validate study plans when prerequisites are removed.
4. Many more others.

### Sharing Study Plan to Develop
-  Sharing study plans with curriculum officers.
