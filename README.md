## Project details
UWA have identified a need for a tool that allows current students, prospective students, and UWA staff, to create study plans of the university’s courses. Currently, study plans are created by hand based on the unit sequence, course rules, and semester availability, which are stored in UWAs CAIDi curriculum management system. A Study Planner tool could reduce the risk of human error and thus allow for the generation of more reliable study plans.

The Study Planner project uses Flask as the backend framework and FlaskSQLAlchemy for the database. For a full list of imported libraries, please view the requirements.txt file.

## Flask API
Flask is a widely used micro web framework for creating APIs in Python, which serves as the backend of our project. 

### Installation 
Install Flask using pip
```
pip install Flask
```
### Flask App
Can refer to the files `__init__.py`, `routes.py`, `models.py`, and `forms.py` in the app folder.

#### /app/__init__.py
Understand the working of the codes:  

```
from flask import Flask
``` 

Import the Flask class.

```
app = Flask(__name__)
```

This creates an instance of the class.

```
from app import routes, models, forms
```
This connects the instance of the class to the routes, models, and forms. 

```
if __name__ == '__main__'
``` 
`__name__` is a special variable in Python which takes the value of the script name. This line ensures that our Flask app runs only when it is executed in the main file and not when it is imported in some other file.

```
app.run(debug=True)
```
Run the Flask application with enabling the debug mode. Whenever code changes, the server will automatically reload and will show an interactive debugger in the browser with occurrences of errors during a request.

#### /app/routes.py
Several routes have been included in the file: /index, /signup, /login, /logout, /account, /createstudyplan-courses, /createstudyplan-majors, /createstudyplan-units, /saveStudyPlan, /faq and a page_not_found(e) function has been set up to deal with invalid routes.

- The /index route renders index.html.
- The /signup route renders signup.html.
- The /login route renders login.html.
- The /logout route redirects to index.html when users log out.
- The /accout route renders myaccount.html.
- The /createstudyplay-course route renders 1grid-createstudyplan.html.
- The /createstudyplay-course route renders 2grid-createstudyplan.html.
- The /createstudyplay-course route renders 3grid-createstudyplan.html.
- The /saveStudyPlan route triggers a save function for a study plan.
- The page_not_found(e) function renders 404.html.

```
from flask import render_template
```
Import the method render_template() to render templates.

```
@app.route(‘/index’, methods=['GET', 'POST'])
``` 
We use the route() decorator to tell Flask what URL should trigger the function. Methods specify which HTTP methods are allowed. The default is ['GET’].

```
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', title='Home')
```
Specify the name of the template and the variables you want to pass to the template engine as keyword arguments and Flask will look for templates in the templates folder.  

#### /app/models.py
This is related to the database and will be further explained in the Database part.

#### /app/forms.py
There are two Flask form inside the file to support the signup function and login function. Each field of the forms are clearly stated with formats and validations have been added to the forms.

## Database 
SQLAlchemy is used as the database for this project, it is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper.

### Database schema

The following diagram shows the abstract desgin for the data storage in the database.   

![Data-Schema](./readmeImages/DataSchema.png)   

### User Table
The User table is used to store the registered user information.
- id is an automatically generated index and is a Primary Key.
- email records user's registered email address. It is unique which means one email address can register for one account
- password_hash records the encrypted password to ensure privacy.

### Four_Sem_SP Table
This table can store a study plan for four semesters with five units each semester at the maximum. Only logged in users can save their study plans into this table.

- selectedCourse, selectedMajor and faculty are straightforward.
- coursecode stands for the unique code for each Course.
- user_id is the Foreign Key linked to the id in the User table.
- Y1S1_1 stands for the first unit planned for year 1, semester 1 and so on. Y2S2_5  stands for the fifth unit (overloading unit) planned for year 2, semester 2


### Interaction with database

#### User Interface
There is no interface presented for users to interact with the tables in the database directly. Users may add values into the database but they may not delete or change any data through the user interface.

2 addition actions are:

- Users can insert values into the User table through Sign Up.
- Users can insert values into the Four_Sem_SP table through save button.

Allowance for dateTime field in Four_Sem_SP table:

- All dateTimes are generated in UTC time zone when they are stored in the database.
- To ensure an accurate dateTime for the end user we convert dateTime field into the relevant local time zone in Routes.py.

#### Python Script
SQLAlchemy is a Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper. Users may write SQL queries in python file to create, read, update and delete data in the database.

#### Installation and connection before applying SQL queries.

Installing The Package   
`pip install sqlalchemy`

Connecting to the database   
`import sqlalchemy as db`   
`engine = db.create_engine('sqlite:///app/db.sqlite')`   
`connection = engine.connect()`   
`metadata = db.MetaData()`   

#### Command Line

Type ***python*** in Terminal to start a Python interactive session, then follow the **Python Script** instruction.

## Data
All course and unit data used in the Study Planner project has been exported from the UWA CAIDi system. Two files have been key in generating the functionality of the Study Planner tool (both to be found in the *static* subfolder), 1. Json-export.csv, and 2. Unit list.csv. Both these files are processed in *routes.py*, but also in the relevant .html pages using JavaScript (*1course-createstudyplan.html*, *2major-createstudyplan.html* and *3grid-createstudyplan.html*).

### Json-export.csv
The *Json-export.csv* file contains information on all courses at UWA between the years of 2018 and 2022.

Attributes used includes:
* CourseID
* Year
* Structure (this attribute contains all units that belong to the selected course or major/specialisation)
* ListMajors
* Title
* Faculty
* Availability (describes the availability of the course - e.g., a course may not be available in 2022)
* IntakePeriods describes whether a course is available at the beginning of a year, mid-year, or both - these values are used to filter the 'Select starting year/semester' dropdown)

### Unit list.csv
The *Unit list.csv* file is an amalgamation of eight active unit sequence csv files for various degrees. These files were processed by *join_individual_unit_lists.py* - a program which concatenates and groups units by unit code and exports the result to a new .csv file, *Unit list.csv*. All files are found in the subfolder *static* > *unit data files*.

Attributes used includes:
* Code
* Title
* Availabilities (describes the availability of the unit, e.g., Semester 1 only)
* Content (short description of the unit)
* Outcomes (short description of the outcomes of the unit)
* Corequisites (describes if there are any co-requisites to the unit)
* Incompatibilities (describes if there are any incompatible units related to the selected unit)
* Prerequisites (describes if there are any prerequisites to taking the selected unit)

### Making updates to or exchanging the .csv files
Any changes that are made to the .csv files must follow a certain ruleset. If exchanging any of the .csv files, it is important they are exported from CAIDi the same way as they were when we were initially handed the data.

**Changing the year from 2022**

* In the *routes.py* file, there is a line that reads: `selectedYear = 2022`. Changing the year and saving the file will filter the data in *Json-export.csv*, i.e., course data, to only hold data for the selected year.
* In *3grid-createstudyplan.html*, there is a variable: `notavailableinyear`, that contains the content `Not available 2022`. This variable is used to provide the correct class names to units in the 'select units' pane. Change the year to correspond with the year in the `selectedYear` variable.

**Other reflections**

* The *join_individual_unit_lists.py* file is redundant should the Curriculum Office be able to produce an active sequence unit .csv file that contains all units at UWA.

### Login
> login.html

If the user is registered, the user can login using his/her credentials that used at the time of registration. User can use this login page(**Figure 2**) to create, save and delete study plans. If the user enters wrong credentials, the system will alert this and ask to enter correct details. This page also has 'remember me' functionality that allows user to save his/her login information and do not have to be enter the details each login time. If the user is not registered, he can click 'Don't have an account?' link to directs to sign up page. We will be adding forgot password actionality in sprint 3.

### My Account
> account.html

All logged in users are able to access this page (**Figure 5**). The account page displays the user's saved study plans and allows them to load or delete them. The user may also create a new study plan which will navigate them to the 1grid-createstudyplan.html page.

This page will render a list of study plans dynamically based on the number of rows returned when querying the Four_Sem_SP table by the user's unique id. If no rows are returned then a default message is displayed. 

The load study plan function uses AJAX to send a study plan id to the backend. The id is used to query the Four_Sem_SP table and reassigns the value of the global variables needed to generate a study plan based on the values stored in the Four_Sem_SP table. The user is then redirected to the select units page with their information loaded into the grid. 

The delete study plan function uses AJAX to send a study plan id to the backend. The id is used to query the Four_Sem_SP table and the returned row is then removed and the table is updated. Upon the clicking the delete button the page reloads, generating the study plan list based on the new state of the Four_Sem_SP table.


### Creating a study plan
The following steps outline how a user goes about the process of creating a study plan, as well as how data is processed in the background to generate the view that users end up with. 

#### Selecting a course
> 1grid-createstudyplan.html

1. Users start by selecting the course they are interested in from the first dropdown on this page. This filters the second dropdown, where users select what semester and year they wish to start studying, based on the availability of the course.
2. The semester/year start dropdown determines what the grid page looks like. If a user selects a Semester 2 start, this will be reflected on the grid. Currently, the Study Planner supports only a Semester 1, 2023 or Semester 2, 2023 start.

The selected course and beginning year/semester gets sent via AJAX post() to *routes.py* where it is processed to determine what the next page will look like to the user (upon pressing the 'Continue' button).

#### Selecting a major or specialisation
> 2grid-createstudyplan.html

Based on what course the user selected in the previous step, this page will either appear or not appear. This is determined by whether or not the course has a major or specialisation. E.g., If a user selects the Bachelor of Commerce degree, this page will be produced with a dropdown containing 7 majors. These majors are deducted from the *Json-export.csv* file's *ListMajors* attribute. Specialisations on the other hand, are contained within the *Structure* column. If a major or specialisation is selected, it overrides the course selected in the step prior so that the correct units can be pulled based on the major/specialisation decision.

If a user would select a course that does not contain any major or specialisation, they will be redirected instantly to the page described below.

#### Selecting units
> 3grid-createstudyplan.html

This page consists of two windows. One where the user finds all unit groups and units, and one which consists of information relating to the selected course, potential major or specialisation, the faculty that heads the course and the course code, as well as the grid system.

**Unit groups and units**

On the left hand pane under the 'Select units' heading, the selected course or major/specialisation's unit group(s) (e.g., Core, Option, Conversion, etc.) and their associated units will appear. The unit groups have point trackers to the right of the header which track how many unit points are required from each group based upon a numerical value found in the *typeInto* field contained within the *Structure* attribute in *Json-export.csv* (in the event that this field has no point requirement data the *introduction* field may be used). The number of points taken from that group in the study grid is tracked based on the *unitPoints* field, also within the *Structure* attribute. If the user exceeds the required amount the point trakcer will turn orange to signify that the user has surplus unit points in that unit group. Each unit group has an information tooltip to the right of its point tracker which, upon hover, describes the unit group based on information deducted from the *typeInto* field contained within the *Structure* attribute in *Json-export.csv*.

Each unit has a color. This color explains when it is available to study (pulls from the *Availabilities* attribute contained in *Unit list.csv*). At the bottom of the left hand pane, each key is described to the user (Semester 1 only, Semester 2 only, etc.). The color palette that is used, 'Wong', has been developed with the intention of being accessible to people who are colorblind (source: https://bit.ly/3r4aukN).

Upon click of a unit, a modal appears. This modal contains information about the unit and pulls data from *Content*, *Outcomes*, *Prerequisites*, *Corequisites*, *Incompatibilities* and *Incompatibilities* attributes (*Unit list.csv*). The credit points and handbook URL are both pulled from the *Structure* attribute in *Json-export.csv*. This allows the user to read about individual units. If a unit clicked on does not exist within *Unit list.csv*, it will only show information pulled from the *Json-export.csv* file.

**Grid system**

The grid system is made up of two parts. The top part provides details to the user in regard to their selected course. The second part which fills the majority of the page consists of the grid system. A layout made up of rows where each row is a semester made up of a total of 5 boxes (one box for each unit). A normal full time study load at UWA is 3-4 units, but students are allowed to overload semesters by taking a maximum of 5 units per semester. Clicking on the 'Add' button for a Semester row adds overloading functionality, and if the 'Add' button has been clicked, a 'Remove' button will appear to remove overloading.

The grid system is currently based on the HTML Drag and Drop API. This allows for units to be dragged from the unit selection pane onto a box in the grid. Unfortunately it is an API that is not supported in Safari, and is not supported via touch.

**Grid constraints**
Many units have constraining features, for example, prerequisites, co-requisites and incompatibilities. The Study Planner tool is able to handle constraints based on the following rules:
* Unit availability
* Unit co-requisites
* Unit incompatibilities
* Unit prerequisites*

If a conflict has occurred on the grid, a floater (alert) will appear at the bottom of the page with a message describing the conflict.

\* Unit prerequisites at UWA are extremely complex. Currently, the system manages only one - situations where a prerequisite unit must be taken prior to a triggering unit (see below for example). The prerequisite unit must be in the list of units for the conflict alert to show. 

|![Prerequisites](./readmeImages/prerequisites.png)|
|:--:|
| <b> Figure 6</b>|

**Save Study Plan**

This page also includes functionality like saving a study plan to a user account, for logged in users, and downloading a study plan as a PDF. The PDF function takes the dimensions and content of the grid as saves it as a PDF. 

**Loaded Study Plan**
If a study plan is loaded then a dictionary is created based on the values stored in the Four_Sem_SP table. The values in the headings of the page are loaded via jinina, however units in the study plan are generated via javascript and a number of child elements need to be created and appended to the grid divs. Loaded units need to be tracked in the point trackers of the unit groups, unit points are not stored in the Four_Sem_SP table therefore the *unitPoints* field contained within the *Structure* attribute in *Json-export.csv* is referenced to provide the value. 

If a unit is loaded into the study grid then it is not rendered in the select units panel, but the user has the ability to return it there through the use of the remove button.
